torch
=====

Torch is my first app on Blackberry OS 7.
Now I have a Blackberry CURVE 9360 with me and before it I used a Nokia E63.
They all have a QWERTY keyboard and I like the feeling when you touch on it.
I looked up some basic apps in Blackberry AppWorld and under poor light condition I'd like to use Nokia E63's torch which hardly found on Blackberry.
Also I am a coder. I think I could make it for myself.
Some app could work such as FlashLight but with Ads :(
I looked through the Blackberry developer samples to find some examples.
Finally I finished this app.
Although it looks just like a demo but it works well.
You could start it by click space key then use Quit key to close it.
All code are open souce, without any Ads or backdoors.
I tried to publish it to Blackberry AppWorld but it has too many steps so I quit.
May this small app could solve somebodies problem.:)
